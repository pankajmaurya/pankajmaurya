### Hi there 👋

I am Pankaj Maurya, a software engineer from India. I have worked for some large tech organizations building and maintaining platform products like Google Billing 3.0, Google Workspace, Rubrik Cloud Data Protection and Uber's Data Platform.

#### Getting in touch

* [pankajmaurya@gmail.com](mailto:pankajmaurya@gmail.com)

I rarely tweet as [<img src="https://openapi-generator.tech/img/icons/twitter.svg" height="13" width="13"/> @bobbyisgood](https://twitter.com/bobbyisgood).

🌱 I'm on a break and exploring trends in technology spanning Large Language Models, functional programming and low code paradigms (currently porting [the Godspeed application framework](https://www.godspeed.systems) to the JVM, also curious about Open API based code generation and automation frameworks)
Update: Recently wrapped up a pilot of physiotherapy exercise tracking using computer vision tech. See [linked in post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7347950250050953216-TkNz)

⚡ Fun fact: I have played some music in the past. In early years, I was a lot into Rock and Metal. Some old recordings https://soundcloud.com/Pankaj-Maurya-1 and https://soundcloud.com/alberte-einsteine . In the last few years I took up Hindustani music (https://youtu.be/uyHJ__d91Hk) to expand my horizons.
