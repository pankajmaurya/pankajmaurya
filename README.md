### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Pankaj Maurya, a software engineer from India. I have worked for some large tech organizations building and maintaining platform products like Google Billing 3.0, Google Workspace, Rubrik Cloud Data Protection and Uber's Data Platform.

ðŸŒ± I'm on a break and exploring trends in technology spanning Large Language Models, functional programming and low code paradigms (currently porting [the Godspeed application framework](https://www.godspeed.systems) to the JVM, also curious about Open API based code generation and automation frameworks)
Update: Recently wrapped up a pilot of physiotherapy exercise tracking using computer vision tech. See [linked in post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7347950250050953216-TkNz)

âš¡ Fun fact: I have played some music in the past. In early years, I was a lot into Rock and Metal. Some old recordings are [this](https://soundcloud.com/Pankaj-Maurya-1) and [this](https://soundcloud.com/alberte-einsteine) . In the last few years I took up [Hindustani music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlSlbhLAM28&list=PL7eJwmV22aNBhXQ0Qc4VyUBBgPH-z8iUQ&index=3) to expand my horizons.
