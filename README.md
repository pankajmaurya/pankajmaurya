I rarely tweet as [<img src="https://openapi-generator.tech/img/icons/twitter.svg" height="13" width="13"/> @bobbyisgood](https://twitter.com/bobbyisgood).

ðŸŒ± I'm on a break and exploring trends in technology spanning Large Language Models, functional programming and low code paradigms (currently porting Godspeed to the JVM, also curious about Open API based code generation and automation frameworks)

Checkout some of my pinned repositories.
