Exploring emerging technologies and trends:

I am exploring various AI tools to assist me in content creation [My content production setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roMb5ImBz2U).
**Recent Project** I finished reading the Database internals book by Alex Petrov and felt motivated enough to hack. Check out [TinyDB](https://github.com/pankajmaurya/tinydb). I got back to doing some C coding in 2025 and loved it for a few weeks.   
  
## üéµ Musical Journey
Music has been a constant in my life, evolving across different genres and traditions:

**Early Years**: Rock and Metal enthusiast with some recordings on SoundCloud:

**Recent Years**: Exploring [Hindustani classical music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlSlbhLAM28&list=PL7eJwmV22aNBhXQ0Qc4VyUBBgPH-z8iUQ&index=3) to broaden my musical horizons and connect with traditional Indian art forms.
